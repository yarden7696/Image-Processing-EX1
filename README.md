# Image-Processing-EX1 
 
 Python version: 3.9.2  
 platform: pycharm 

 ### This assignment deals with the following topics:
- Histogram equalization
- Optimal image quantization
- Gamma Correction

 ### files to submit:
**ex1_main.py:** the purpose of this main test is to test the functions i implemented in ex1_utils.py and gamma.py files.  

**ex1_utils.py:** this file implement the following functions-  
- imReadAndConvert: reads an image, and returns the image converted as requested  
- imDisplay: reads an image as RGB or GRAY_SCALE and displays it  
- transformRGB2YIQ: converts an RGB image to YIQ color space  
- transformYIQ2RGB: converts an YIQ image to RGB color space  
- hsitogramEqualize: equalizes the histogram of a given image  
- quantizeImage: quantized an image into **nQuant** colors  

**gamma.py:** the purpose of this file is to performs gamma correction on an image with a given Î³  
- gammaDisplay: GUI for gamma correction

I chose image testImg1.jpg because my dream is to see the northern lights, i really like the colors and i wanted to see how the functions i wrote will affect this image.
I chose image testImg2.jpg because i really like 'The Beatles', i chose a famous picture of them that is not clear and i wanted to see the effect on it.
