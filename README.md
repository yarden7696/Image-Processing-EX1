1.ex1_main.py: The purpose of this main test is to test the functions i implemented in ex1_utils.py and gamma.py files.

2.ex1_utils.py: A file that contains the following functions that perform operations on images:
- imReadAndConvert: Loading grayscale and RGB image representations
- imDisplay: Displaying the images
- transformRGB2YIQ: Transforming RGB color images to the YIQ color space
- transformYIQ2RGB: Conversion in the other direction
- hsitogramEqualize: Performing intensity transformations - histogram equalization
- quantizeImage: Performing optimal quantization

3.gamma.py: The purpose of this file is to performs gamma correction on an image with a given Î³
- gammaDisplay: GUI for gamma correction
