1.ex1_main.py: The purpose of this main test is to test the functions i implemented in ex1_utils.py and gamma.py files.

2.ex1_utils.py: this file implement the following functions-
- imReadAndConvert: reads an image, and returns the image converted as requested
- imDisplay: reads an image as RGB or GRAY_SCALE and displays it
- transformRGB2YIQ: converts an RGB image to YIQ color space
- transformYIQ2RGB: converts an YIQ image to RGB color space
- hsitogramEqualize: equalizes the histogram of a given image
- quantizeImage: quantized an image into **nQuant** colors

3.gamma.py: The purpose of this file is to performs gamma correction on an image with a given Î³
